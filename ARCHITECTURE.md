# Technical Architecture Blueprint: E-VARA

E-VARA is engineered for high availability, security, and scalability. This document outlines the system architecture and technical decisions that underpin the platform.

## 1. Core Philosophy
The platform operates on a "Privacy-First Intelligence" model. All sensitive identifiers are hashed client-side before being processed by the intelligence engine, ensuring PII compliance while maintaining powerful correlation capabilities.

## 2. Technology Stack
- **Frontend Core**: React 18 with TypeScript for type-safe UI development.
- **Build Tooling**: Vite for lightning-fast development and optimized production builds.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3 with a custom HUD design system.
- **Backend-as-a-Service**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Edge Functions, Storage).
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for efficient server-state synchronization.
- **Visualization**: Recharts for data analytics and Framer Motion for high-end UI animations.

## 3. Data Flow & Security
### Identity Monitoring Pipeline
1. **Input**: User provides identity markers (Email, Username, Name).
2. **Privacy Layer**: Web Crypto API generates SHA-256 hashes of identifiers on the client.
3. **Transmission**: Hashes are sent to Supabase Edge Functions over TLS.
4. **Correlation**: Edge Functions query historical leak databases and social graph APIs using the provided hashes.
5. **Persistence**: Findings are stored in PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS) ensuring users only see their own data.

### Threat Surface Mapping
- **Vector Analysis**: Real-time correlation of metadata to identify potential attack paths.
- **Auditing**: Automated generation of PDF dossiers using `jsPDF` for executive reporting.

## 4. Scalability
- **Serverless Compute**: Deno-based Edge Functions scale automatically with demand.
- **Database Indexing**: Optimized PostgreSQL indexes on identity hashes for sub-second lookup times.
- **Asset Delivery**: Static assets served via global CDN for low latency.

## 5. Deployment Strategy
- **Environment Parity**: Strict adherence to `.env` configuration for dev, staging, and production.
- **CI/CD**: Recommended GitHub Actions pipeline for automated linting, testing, and deployment.
